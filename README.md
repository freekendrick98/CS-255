- Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project is a website that is designed to help people pass their drivers exam. The website offers lessons as well as road test. The client is Liam, the owner of DriverPass. The DriverPass system would allow users to create accounts that would enable them to interact with the DriverPass website. The system would also allow users to take online classes as well as schedule road test. The client specified that they were not worried about adding onto the system immediately, but additions are always an option.

- What did you do particularly well?
I keep everything as organized as possible. The charts were not very difficult or time consuming to make, it was describing them that was more time consuming. To the naked eye the charts are nothing more than boxes with arrows or lines connecting them.

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
More detail in the UML class chart would be the first thing I would add. The outline is there but all the small details such as more attributes are missing.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Reading the interview transcript time and time again is how I interpreted and implemented the user’s needs. It is of the utmost importance that the users’ needs are considered when designing a system. The system should be as accessible to the user as possible while keeping their needs in mind. If the user cant comfortably use the system then they will cease to do so.

- How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My approach was to read all the details and to note what the client wanted their system to do. Getting carried away with a design without referencing the design constraints can lead to a system functioning exactly the opposite of how it was intended to.
